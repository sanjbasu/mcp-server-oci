Agent System Implementation
This section details the implementation of the multi-agent system that uses the MCP server.
Architecture Overview
The multi-agent system consists of several specialized agents that collaborate to manage and resolve incidents. Each agent has a specific role and uses the MCP server to access tools and share information.
Key Components

Base Agent: Provides common functionality for all agents
Specialized Agents: Implement specific roles and capabilities
Multi-Agent System: Orchestrates agent collaboration
MCP Client: Connects agents to the MCP server

Agent Roles and Responsibilities
1. Incident Manager

Coordinates the overall incident management process
Collects information from other agents
Generates comprehensive incident reports
Implements: src/agents/incident-manager.ts

2. Diagnostic Agent

Analyzes system logs and metrics
Identifies potential issues and root causes
Provides detailed diagnostic information
Implements: src/agents/diagnostic-agent.ts

3. Solution Agent

Proposes remediation strategies
Ranks and customizes solutions based on the specific context
Provides immediate and long-term solution recommendations
Implements: src/agents/solution-agent.ts

4. Knowledge Base Agent

Searches for similar historical incidents
Identifies patterns across incidents
Provides insights from past resolutions
Implements: src/agents/knowledge-base-agent.ts

Creating a New Agent
To create a new specialized agent:

Create a new file in the src/agents/ directory, e.g., new-agent.ts
Extend the BaseAgent class:
typescript
import { BaseAgent } from './agent-base';

export class NewSpecializedAgent extends BaseAgent {
  constructor(client, name = 'NewAgent', role = 'Specialized role description') {
    super(client, name, role);
  }
  
  // Implement specialized methods
  async performSpecializedTask(parameters): Promise<any> {
    // Implement task
  }
  
  // Override the receiveMessage method to handle specialized requests
  override async receiveMessage(senderName: string, message: string): Promise<string> {
    // Handle specialized requests
    if (message.includes('special task')) {
      // Process specialized task
    }
    
    // Fall back to default handling for other messages
    return super.receiveMessage(senderName, message);
  }
}
Register the agent in the multi-agent-system.ts file:
typescript
import { NewSpecializedAgent } from '../agents/new-agent';

// In the initialize method:
const newAgent = new NewSpecializedAgent(mcpClient);
this.registerAgent(newAgent);
Agent Communication
Agents communicate with each other through the coordinateWithAgent method in the IncidentManager class:
typescript
// Example of agent communication
const diagnosticTask = `Please provide a detailed diagnostic analysis for this incident: "${description}"`;
const diagnosticResponse = await this.incidentManager.coordinateWithAgent(diagnosticAgent, diagnosticTask);

Each agent implements a receiveMessage method that processes incoming messages and generates appropriate responses.
